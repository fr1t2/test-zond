After setting up your wallet (via the [Web3 Wallet interface](/testnet/usage/web3-wallet), CLI, or other methods), you’ll need test Zond to begin experimenting. To acquire some, we recommend reaching out to community members already testing Zond—many are happy to share spare test tokens. 

Alternatively, join our official Discord server and post a request in the dedicated #zond channel for assistance.
