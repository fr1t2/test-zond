# Reporting success

Hearing about success for us is useful to track user experience on various operating systems and setups.  Please consider visiting our [GitHub discussion page](https://github.com/theQRL/go-zond/discussions) and sharing your experience.

We're particularly interested in hearing about your experience of downloading and installing the software, and whether you were able to get up and running without any issues.  Let us know your operating system version and any other details you think might be useful.
