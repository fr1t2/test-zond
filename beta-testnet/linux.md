# Installing on Linux

::: info
Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 (x86_64)
:::

This page contains instructions for installing the Zond node on Linux.

## Downloading binaries

The Zond node & PoS validator are available as pre-compiled binaries for some operating systems. The latest releases can be seen and downloaded from the [go-zond releases page](https://github.com/theQRL/go-zond/releases/) and [qrysm releases page](https://github.com/theQRL/qrysm/releases/) on GitHub.

## Building from Source

### Dependencies

The Zond node requires the following dependencies to be installed in order to be built from source:

- build-essential (gcc, g++, make, etc.) `sudo apt install build-essential`
- Golang v1.21 or later **and** 1.20.12

::: info TIP
gobrew is recommended to control go version on MacOS / Linux. Install with:\
```curl -sLk https://git.io/gobrew | sh -```
Follow the instructions to add gobrew to your path and confirm it is working with ```gobrew --version```
:::

### Clone the Zond repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theQRL/go-zond.git
git clone https://github.com/theQRL/qrysm.git
```

### Build go-zond (the Execution Engine) with Golang v1.21 or later

``` bash
gobrew use 1.21.5
cd go-zond/
make gzond
cp build/bin/gzond ../
cd ..
```

### Build qrsym (Consensus Engine) with Golang v1.20

```bash
cd qrysm/
gobrew use 1.20.12
go build -o=../qrysmctl ./cmd/qrysmctl
go build -o=../beacon-chain ./cmd/beacon-chain
go build -o=../validator ./cmd/validator
```

::: info

If using a system-wide installation of Golang, ensure v1.20 is available to build the Consensus Engine and specify the version when building:

```bash
go install golang.org/dl/go1.20@latest
go1.20 download
go1.20 build -o=../qrysmctl.exe ./cmd/qrysmctl
go1.20 build -o=../beacon-chain.exe ./cmd/beacon-chain
go1.20 build -o=../validator.exe ./cmd/validator
```

:::

### Troubleshooting

While the instructions above are tested on fresh OS installs, there will be a variety of system configurations that may cause issues.

Some problems and solutions encountered by our community testers are listed below.

If you encounter any other problems (or the solutions don't work for you), please [open an issue](https://github.com/theQRL/test-zond/issues).

#### 1. Missing `-lstdc++` library

```bash
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++: No such file or directory
```

**Solutions:**\
    a. Install the `libstdc++-12-dev` library with `sudo apt install libstdc++-12-dev` \
    or \
    b. Update sources and explicitly specify packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential make gcc-multilib clang`
